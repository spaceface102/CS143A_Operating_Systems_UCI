--This course
-inspired by MIT 6.828
-will be studying the xv6 operating system
    -around 9k lines of code, definitely a lot smaller
        than most other operating systems
    -xv6 also has a book
    -and source code printout (look at the lecture slides
        for the link to the book and the printout)
        -an index of all the system calls and functions
            in the source code for the operating system
    -xv6 is a unix like operating systems

--Tips
-read the fucking source code of xv6
    -it will allow you to really understand 
        what the fuck is going operating

--Run the hello world kernel
-its on github
-woah, you can run the whole operating system on bare metal
    -prof flashed a usb and inserted to an old laptop and ran
        a basic kernel!!!!!! HOLY COW
